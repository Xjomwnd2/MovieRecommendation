# Overview
This project is a simple but comprehensive Movie Recommendation System written in Java. It demonstrates how core Java concepts — like classes, objects, collections, and algorithms — can be used to build a working system that helps users find movies they might enjoy. The program supports creating user profiles, rating movies, adding favorite genres, and generating personalized recommendations using different strategies like content-based, collaborative, popularity-based, and a hybrid approach.
I built this project to deepen my practical Java skills, especially around handling data structures, implementing recommendation logic, and creating an interactive user experience through a console menu.
